# Ecovision: Tree Count Detection from Aerial Imagery

**Ecovision** is a tree detection system that leverages aerial imagery to identify and count trees in a given area. This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze images and detect tree patterns, contributing to environmental monitoring and forestry management.

## Features

- **Automated Tree Detection**: Identifies tree locations within aerial images.
- **Image Analysis**: Analyzes images using deep learning to classify areas as containing trees or non-tree objects.
- **Customizable Model**: Model architecture can be adjusted based on accuracy requirements and specific environmental data.
- **Environmental Impact**: Provides valuable insights for forest conservation, reforestation projects, and urban planning.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains sample datasets or instructions for acquiring aerial images.
- **models/**: Stores trained models and associated weights.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **results/**: Contains output files, such as detected tree coordinates and count statistics.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ecovision.git
   cd Ecovision
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data**: Run the data preprocessing script to prepare images for model input.
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model**: Train the model using the provided training script.
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Detect Trees**: Use a trained model to count trees in new aerial images.
   ```bash
   python scripts/detect_trees.py --input path/to/image.jpg --output results/output.jpg
   ```

## Results

Results, including detected tree locations and counts, are saved in the `results/` directory. Visualizations of tree detection can be generated to verify model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model development.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library.
- **NumPy, Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tools.
